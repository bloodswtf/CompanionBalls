Just kidding, there's no restrictions that I've set,
feel free to do anything to this code without any restrictions
from my part. If you're nice you could include this text file in any projects
that uses this port of the Sphero API to give me and my thesis work credit for
developing the port.

Also a bit of code from the Robotix team has been used! So many big thanks! ;)
